                    <h3>Common UPVC Issues We Resolve</h3>
                    <p>Wear and misalignment can make UPVC doors hard to operate and less secure.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seized or jammed locking strips</li>
                        <li>Dropped doors and misaligned frames</li>
                        <li>Drafts caused by worn seals</li>
                        <li>Replacement of obsolete hardware</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Maintain and Upgrade Your UPVC Doors</h3>
                    <p>Regular servicing extends the life of your doors and allows for security upgrades such as anti-snap cylinders.</p>

                    <h3>Expert Adjustments and Realignments</h3>
                    <p>Seasonal temperature changes and frequent use can cause doors to drop or warp. Our technicians realign frames, adjust hinges and re-pack double glazing to ensure your door closes smoothly and seals properly against drafts.</p>
                    <p>We also lubricate moving parts and replace worn rollers or keeps to keep your multi-point locking system operating reliably.</p>

                    <h3>Energy Efficiency and Security Upgrades</h3>
                    <p>Older uPVC doors often lack modern energy-saving features. We can fit new weather seals, install energy-efficient glazing and upgrade locks to meet current security standards. Anti-snap cylinders and reinforced handles protect against forced entry, while letterbox restrictors and sash jammers offer extra peace of mind.</p>

                    <h3>Comprehensive uPVC Maintenance Plans</h3>
                    <p>Preventative care saves money in the long run. Our maintenance plans include annual inspections, minor adjustments and early detection of component wear. Landlords and property managers benefit from scheduled visits that keep multiple properties functioning and secure.</p>
                    <p>If a mechanism is beyond repair, we supply and fit matching replacements from leading manufacturers. Our vans carry a wide selection of gearboxes, cylinders and handles so most repairs can be completed in a single visit.</p>
                    <p>Keep your uPVC doors and windows working like new with our specialist repair service. We cover all areas of London and provide clear, upfront pricing on every job.</p>
