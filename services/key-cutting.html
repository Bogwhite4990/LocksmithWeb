                    <p>Visit our workshop or arrange a mobile visit. Most keys are cut within minutes and tested before you leave.</p>

                    <h3>Advanced Cutting Technology</h3>
                    <p>Our workshop is equipped with state-of-the-art key cutting machines that replicate even the most intricate security keys. Laser-cut car keys, dimple keys and tubular keys are all produced with millimetre accuracy to guarantee a perfect fit.</p>
                    <p>We stock blanks for thousands of lock brands, allowing us to cut spares for rare or imported locks that many shops cannot handle. Each key is hand-finished and deburred to ensure smooth operation.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile Key Cutting at Your Doorstep</h3>
                    <p>Can't make it to our shop? Our mobile service brings professional key duplication to your home or business. Ideal for landlords managing multiple properties, we can cut large batches of keys on-site and label them for easy distribution.</p>

                    <h3>Why Spare Keys Matter</h3>
                    <p>Having a spare key saves time and money when keys are misplaced or locked inside. It also reduces wear on your original key, prolonging the life of both the key and the lock. We recommend creating duplicates for family members, trusted neighbours and employees who require regular access.</p>
                    <p>For added security, ask about our restricted key profiles that prevent unauthorised duplication. Only registered users can order copies, giving you complete control over who holds keys to your property.</p>
                    <p>Whatever your requirements, our key cutting specialists provide friendly advice and rapid service. Visit us or schedule a mobile appointment to keep your property secure with accurately cut spare keys.</p>
