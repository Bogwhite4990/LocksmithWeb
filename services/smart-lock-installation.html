                    <h3>Benefits of Going Smart</h3>
                    <p>Smart locks offer convenience and full control over who accesses your property.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Temporary codes for guests and contractors</li>
                        <li>Activity logs and notifications</li>

                        <li>Battery health monitoring</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Professional Setup and Support</h3>
                    <p>We handle everything from fitting to app configuration and provide aftercare to keep your system running smoothly.</p>

                    <h3>Choosing the Right Smart Lock</h3>
                    <p>There are many smart lock models on the market, each offering different features such as keypad entry, biometric sensors, or Bluetooth connectivity. We guide you through the options to ensure compatibility with your door type and existing security systems.</p>
                    <p>Our team can recommend locks that work with popular platforms like Apple HomeKit, Google Home and Amazon Alexa, allowing seamless voice control and automation routines.</p>

                    <h3>Secure Remote Management</h3>
                    <p>With remote access, you can check lock status and grant entry from anywhere in the world. Time-limited digital keys are ideal for holiday lets and Airbnb properties, while permanent users can have personalised codes or smartphone permissions.</p>
                    <p>All data is encrypted and stored securely, and we help you set strong passwords and two-factor authentication to keep hackers out.</p>

                    <h3>Future-Proof Your Property</h3>
                    <p>Smart locks are easy to update, meaning new features and security patches can be installed via firmware updates. Should you sell your home or change tenants, permissions are easily revoked and reset without changing the hardware.</p>
                    <p>We also provide maintenance packages to check battery levels, update software and ensure mechanical components remain in top condition.</p>
                    <p>Embrace the convenience of keyless entry with our professional smart lock installation service. From consultation to ongoing support, we make modern access control simple and secure.</p>
