                    <h3>When Should You Replace Your Locks?</h3>
                    <p>Damaged, outdated or compromised locks put your property at risk. Replace them after a move, a break-in or whenever keys go missing.</p>
                    <h3>Quality Locks Installed by Experts</h3>
                    <p>We fit locks from top manufacturers to meet British Standards and insurance requirements.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Free security assessments</li>
                        <li>Disposal of old locks</li>
                        <li>Multiple key copies supplied</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Upgrade to Insurance-Approved Security</h3>
                    <p>Not all locks are created equal. We install British Standard BS3621 and TS007 locks that satisfy insurer requirements and provide enhanced resistance against picking, drilling and snapping. Our locksmiths explain the differences between lock grades so you can make an informed choice.</p>
                    <p>Upgrading your locks can also improve energy efficiency and reduce drafts, particularly when replacing outdated uPVC mechanisms. We carry a range of finishes and styles to match your existing décor.</p>

                    <h3>Our Lock Replacement Process</h3>
                    <p>When you book a lock change, we arrive with a selection of suitable replacements. After confirming the model, we remove the old hardware, fit the new lock and test it thoroughly. Any additional keys you require are cut on-site and labelled for convenience.</p>
                    <p>We dispose of old locks responsibly and can re-key other doors to match for simplified access. Need extra protection? Ask about installing door viewers, security chains and hinge bolts during the same visit.</p>

                    <h3>Serving Homes and Businesses Across London</h3>
                    <p>From flats and terraced houses to warehouses and offices, our locksmiths have decades of experience securing properties throughout Greater London. We offer same-day service and 12-month warranties on parts and labour, ensuring you feel safe behind every new lock.</p>
                    <p>If you've experienced a break-in or attempted burglary, we can reinforce doors and provide temporary boarding before fitting stronger locks. Your security is our priority.</p>
